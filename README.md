# Switching-Adaptive-median-filter
It is a new Adaptive switching median filter proposed for improved performance.
A new Adaptive Switching Median (ASWM) filter
for removing impulse noise from corrupted images is presented.
The originality of ASWM(Adaptive switching Median Filter)
is that no a priori Threshold(Constant threshold chosen after
many data-dependent tests) is needed as in the case of a
classical Switching Median filter. Instead, Threshold is computed
locally from image pixel intensity values in a sliding window by
calculating the weighted mean and weighted Standard deviation
and using that to determine whether filtering is needed or not.
